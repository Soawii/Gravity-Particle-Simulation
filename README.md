# Download
Download a .zip in releases, run the .exe in the bin folder.

# Build
### 1. Clone the repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Soawii/Gravity-Particle-Simulation.git  
```  
### 2. Go into the repository folder and build using cmake  
 ```bash  
 cd Gravity-Particle-Simulation  
 mkdir build  
 cd build  
 cmake ..  
 ```  
### 3. Build the solution  
#### Windows:  
Open and build the generated .sln file with Release/Debug mode enabled.    
#### Linux:  
```bash  
make  
```  
### 4. Run the resulting file  
#### Windows:
```bash
cd build/GravitySimulation/bin/
```
And run the .exe
#### Linux:  
```bash
cd GravitySimulation/bin/
./GravitySimulation  
```
